      <div class="yona-paragraph">
        <p>Yona is the only princess of the Kouka Kingdom. Due to her mother's death
        when she was younger, she was primarily raised around her best friends, Hak and 
        Soo-Won. However when one of them kills her father and she is forced to flee
        from the palace, she decides to become strong enough to protect herself.</p>
      </div>
    <h2 name="dog">Hak</h2>
      <div class="hak-paragraph">
        <p>Hak is one of Yona's childhood friends, and her bodyguard.
        He is an orphan but was adopted by the former Wind Tribe general, Son Mundok,
        and became the new general. Hak is known around Kouka as the 'Thunder Beast'
        for his lightning-fast reflexes and speed, and is called the strongest
        soldier in the kingdom.

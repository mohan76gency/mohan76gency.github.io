    <h2 name="dog">Yona</h2>
      <div class="yona-paragraph">
        <h4 name="parasyte">Yona is the only princess of the Kouka Kingdom. Due to her mother's death
        when she was younger, she was primarily raised around her best friends, Hak and 
        Soo-Won. However when one of them kills her father and she is forced to flee
        from the palace, she decides to become strong enough to protect herself.</h4>
      </div>
    <h2 name="dog">Hak</h2>
      <div class="hak-paragraph">
        <h4 name="parasyte">Hak is one of Yona's childhood friends, and her bodyguard.
        He is an orphan but was adopted by the former Wind Tribe general, Son Mundok,
        and became the new general. Hak is known around Kouka as the 'Thunder Beast'
        for his lightning-fast reflexes and speed, and is called the strongest
        soldier in the kingdom.<h4>
      </div>
    <h2 name="dog">Soo-Won</h2>
      <div class="soo-won-paragraph">
        <h4 name="parasyte">Soo-Won is Yona's cousin as well as Hak's best friend.
        He hides his true intelligence beneath his clumsy appearance while around
        others. His father was killed by the Yona's father, the king, and his anger
        led him to conspire to kill the king and take over the throne. Even though
        he has said he will stop anyone who gets in his way, his actions show he still cares about
        Yona and Hak.</h4>

    <h2 name="dog">White Dragon</h2>
      <div class="gija-paragraph">
        <h4 name="parasyte">Gija is the inheritor of the White Dragon's claw, which
        was passed down many generations. He spent most of his life in an isolated village in Kouka,
        living with other descendents of the white dragon. He was the first one
        that Yona met, and also the quickest to be loyal to her after seeing her unique hair color.
        The dragons before him were so eager to serve King Hiryuu's reincarnation
        that Gija's father slashed his claws across his child's back when he learned a new dragon had been
        born, because he knew he could not serve the King.</h4>
        <h4 name="parasyte">Gija initially quarrels with Hak about who should protect Princess Yona,
        but eventually, they learn to respect each other's strengths. While he is fighting, 
        Gija's hand grows very large. The White Dragon's hand is rumored to be able to cut through
        anything, and he keeps it wrapped up most of the time to not attract unwanted attention.<h4>

    <h2 name="dog">Yoon</h2>
      <div class="yoon-paragraph">
        <h4 name="parasyte">Yoon is an orphan who was raised by a priest, Ik-Soo,
        as a child. Because of his feminine appearance, he is often teased; however,
        he is very intelligent. Yoon had a dream to explore the world and learn
        more about its wonders, but did not act on it so he was able to take care of Ik-Soo.
        However, Ik-Soo convinces him to leave with Yona and the others and pursue
        dreams of his own.<h4>
    <h2 name="dog">Ik-Soo</h2>
      <div class="ik-soo-paragraph">
        <h4 name="parasyte">Ik-Soo was the former High Priest of Kouka Kingdom
        before he was thrown out by Soo-Won's father as a child. He spends most of his time
        praying to the Gods for happiness of the people. He is the one who reveals
        the four Dragons to Yona and initiates her quest.<h4>
    <h2 name="dog">Son Mundok</h2>
      <div class="mundok-paragraph">
        <h4 name="parasyte">Son Mundok is the former general of the Wind tribe, and
        Hak's adoptive grandfather. Even though he may seem to be tough, he genuinely
        cares about the others in the Wind tribe and the royal family. He has another adopted grandson,
        Tae-Yeon.<h4>
    <h2 name="dog">Kan Tae-Jun</h2>
      <div class="tae-jun-paragraph">
        <h4 name="parasyte">Kan Tae-Jun is the second son of the Fire tribe general,
        Kan So-Jin. His desire to inherit the throne led him to pursue Yona and Hak 
        when they were forced out of the castle. In this clash, Yona and Hak fell
        off of a cliff, which led Tae-Jun to believe that he had killed them. However, they had survived,
        and were found and healed by Yoon later on.<h4>
    <h2 name="dog">Lee Geun-Tae</h2>
      <div class="geun-tae-paragraph">
        <h4 name="parasyte">Lee Geun-Tae is the head of the Earth tribe who answers
        to Soo-Won after a Battle Game Festival against him, in which he realizes
        the true intelligence of the King. He is admired by his tribe for his
        bravery and strength in battle.<h4>
    <h2 name="dog">Ahn Lili</h2>
      <div class="lili-paragraph">
        <h4 name="parasyte">Ahn Lili is the daughter of the Water tribe general, 
        Ahn Joon-Gi. Her mission is to stop the drug problems that exist in her tribe.
        Originally, she looks down upon Yona and her friends, but learns to trust
        them after she learns that their mission is quite similar to her own.
        After a joint effort from Soo-Won and Hak saves her from being hung, she
        appreciates all that everyone has done for her, and starts to complete
        her goals on her own. She is a common ally between Soo-Won and Yona,
        trusted by both sides.<h4>

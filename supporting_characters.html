        <h4 name="parasyte">Yoon is an orphan who was raised by a priest, Ik-Soo,
        as a child. Because of his feminine appearance, he is often teased; however,
        he is very intelligent. Yoon had a dream to explore the world and learn
        more about its wonders, but did not act on it so he was able to take care of Ik-Soo.
        However, Ik-Soo convinces him to leave with Yona and the others and pursue
        dreams of his own.</h4>

        when they were forced out of the castle. In this clash, Yona and Hak fell
        off of a cliff, which led Tae-Jun to believe that he had killed them. However, they had survived,
        and were found and healed by Yoon later on.</h4>

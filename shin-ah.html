      <div class="shin-ah-paragraph">
        <h5 name="parasyte">Shin Ah is the inheritor of the Blue Dragon's 
        eyes. The village he lives in considers his powers a curse, so
        much that Shin Ah's mom killed herself after she learned that her
        child was born with the Blue Dragon's eyes. They believe that his
        eyes turn people to stone and generally avoided him as a child, so
        Shin Ah became very quiet and reserved. He was taught swordsmanship
        by the previous Dragon, Ao, to protect the village where he lives.
        After Ao died, Shin Ah protected the village from an army,unleashing
        his power on them. This forced the village into hiding, so they would
        not be targeted.<h5>
        <h5 name="parasyte">Shin Ah's eyes have the ability to see great
        distances and paralyze anyone who looks into them. However, there
        is backlash and he becomes paralyzed for a short time as well.
        Shin Ah usually covers his face with a mask to avoid making eye contact,
        but starts wearing a cloth tied around his head after he decies to help Yona, because
        the mask attracts attention. He is thankful to Yona for being
        the first one to treat him with kindness. He maily uses a sword in battle,
        and only uses his power as a last resort.<>h5
